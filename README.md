Project Title: Stock Market Prediction Using Deep Learning

Description:
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting stock market trends, 
specifically focusing on predicting whether Apple's stock price will increase or decrease over a given time period. 
The model leverages historical price data, financial indicators, and market sentiment to make informed predictions.

Data Collection:
Gather historical Apple stock data, financial indicators, and news articles from reliable sources.
Preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.
Feature Engineering:
Create new features, such as moving averages, momentum indicators, and sentiment scores.
Model Training:
Train the deep learning model (e.g., LSTM, CNN) on the prepared data.
Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Conduct backtesting to assess the model's ability to generate profitable trading signals.
Deployment:
Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.
Additional Notes:

The project's code is organized into modules for better maintainability.
The trained model and its weights are saved for future use.
The README file provides a detailed explanation of the project's structure, dependencies, and usage.
